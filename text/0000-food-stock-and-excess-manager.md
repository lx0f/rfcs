# Food & Excess Manager

## Pillar

Sustainable Living

## Solution

> This solves the problem as this food management system reduces the 
> amount of food wastage in the system. It also ensures that it gives an 
> opportunity for food to be used no matter what.

__Food & Excess Manager__ is a web based solution that keeps track of: 
- inventory of a `Food Store` (e.g. Fridge)
- expiry dates of each item

It has an inbuilt shopping list and a data visualizer to show the 
impact the user have made on slowing climate change. It has a platform
to handle excess edible food whereby it is sold at a _very_ discounted 
rate, or donated (incentiviced with rewards).

## Motivation

[The Green Plan 2030] has five pillars, one of which is 
[Sustainable Living], which then has 5 key areas to help SG become a
[Zero Waste Nation], one of which is [Food Waste]:

> Food waste is one of the biggest waste streams in Singapore and the 
> amount of food waste generated has grown by around 20% over the last 
> 10 years. In 2019, Singapore generated around 744 million kg of food 
> waste. That is equivalent to 2 bowls of rice per person per day, or 
> around 51,000 double decker buses.

The main driver for the increase in food waste in SG is the growing 
population.

A target for 2030 is to reduce waste to landfill per capita per day by 
30%. This means that SG's `Wasters` need to reduce their food wastage 
rate by adopting _Sustainable Consumption_:

- Not buying more than they need
- Using purchased food before expiry

Its impossible to achieve a _zero `Waster`_ nation in terms of food, 
a possible work around however is to give the excess edible food to 
`Consumers`.

Additionally, wasted edible food could have been given to `Consumers`
who otherwise might not have the means to afford/access food. This kills 
two birds with one stone by:

- Reducing waste
- Provide food to the needy

### Examples

Wasters, those with excess food:
- Businesses/Families that let food to become expired due to lack of attention
- Families that don't keep track of food inventory 
- Families with food wasting habits that are unaware of the consequences of their actions
- Some people that feel the need to purchase more than they need
- Some people that struggle to purchase the _right_ amount

Consumers, those lacking food:
- Some people that cannot afford food as Singapore is an expensive place

### Present Efforts

Currently, there are some adaptation solutions that are being implemented 
right now such as incineration of food waste. However, as the Government 
has stated, building waste disposal facilities is not an optimal solution 
for Singapore or a sustainable solution as Singapore has high land scarcity. 

Due to this, the government has tried to push non-digital mitigation solutions 
such as guidebooks (Education).

### Conclusion

Green Mile have come up with a digital solution that tries to _mitigate_
food wastage to support the governments aim to reduce food wastage and 
save the planet for future generations.
